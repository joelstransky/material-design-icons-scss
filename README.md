# material-design-icons-scss
A scss library for Google's Material Design Icons.

This is based heavily on font-awesome's scss library. Most of the structure and many of the `@mixin`'s have been ported directly over. Why fix it if it aint broke?

Special thanks to [Material Icons](https://materialicons.github.io) for the codepoints to `.scss` mapping script.

### Usage
```
<i class="gmi gmi-3d-rotation></i>
```

### Bower
```
bower install material-design-icons-scss
```
